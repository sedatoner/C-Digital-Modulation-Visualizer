# Digital Modulation Visualizer (C + Python) 

Hey there!  This is a small educational project where I explore digital modulation techniques using two languages:

- **C** for simulating the actual modulation and demodulation logic
- **Python** for visualizing the output with easy to read plots

This project was part of my personal learning journey, and I wanted to combine low-level programming with high-level visualization.

##  What I Did

So here's what I set out to do:

- Take a fixed input bit sequence.
- Apply 3 basic digital modulation techniques:
  - **ASK** – Amplitude Shift Keying
  - **FSK** – Frequency Shift Keying
  - **BPSK** – Binary Phase Shift Keying
- Demodulate each signal back into bits.
- Export the input, modulated, and demodulated values to .txt files.
- Then, use Python and matplotlib to plot each result visually.

##  What I Learned

While building this, I got hands-on experience with:

- Bit-level operations and simulation logic in C
- Writing and reading structured data to/from files
- Basic signal visualization in Python
- Understanding how ASK, FSK, and BPSK behave differently
